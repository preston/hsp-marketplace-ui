				<h1>Quick Start</h1>
				<p><i>Let's be brief.</i> If you've even submitted an app to the Apple App Store or Google Play, you're
					basically looking at the Open Source equivalent with a juicy healthcare twang. The business use
					cases
					are
					very similar to what you're used to. Our focus isn't, however, trying to lock you into a specific
					vendor
					ecosystem or cloud provider. The driving values are unapologetic focus on interoperability
					standards,
					vendor
					neutrality, full stack automation, and fair digital rights management.</p>
				<p></p>

				<p><b>This system is an implementation of the HL7/Logica Health Services Platform Marketplace 2
						specification</b>: a
					REST API for submission, curation, publication, and automated distrution of computable health
					products.
					Ultimately, the aim is to create an networked <i>ecosystem</i> of API-compatible marketplaces, like
					this
					one,
					such that
					providers and independant developers may freely exchange curated assets without the "walled garden"
					issues
					that plague the computing world. And while standards-compliant, plug-and-play health products are
					great,
					closed-source assets are just as well. (But they still must meet the same baseline set of packaging
					and
					validation requirements as F/OSS products.)
				</p>
				<p>
					The API is designed for <i>ease of adoption</i> using present-day web and mobile technologies. All
					resource
					types
					are easy to consume using modern webapp frameworks such as Angular and React, and just as easy with
					Ruby,
					Python, Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, Groovy, and anything with decent HTTP/REST support.</p>

				<h2>Client Developer Overview</h2>
				<p>This system is not a fluffy academic thought experiment in abstract meta-frameworks for developing
					conceptual
					whatevers. It addresses
					a multitude of provoking HIT ecosystem challenges in a specific way, but isn't a kitchen sink.
					Grokingly, it
					is:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>REST only</b>. No SOAP. HATEOAS principles somewhat apply.</li>
					<li><b>Not FHIR endpoints</b>. We support publishing your FHIR app servers, CDS Hooks services, and
						even
						raw
						resource data all day long, but <b>the API itself is not a
							FHIR
							thing</b>. </li>
					<li><b>JSON only</b>. No XML.. not even HTML. No YML nor CSVs. For all practical purposes it is
						completely
						unnecessary to support XML, and it's surprisingly annoying to work with it in complex webapps.
					</li>
					<li><b>Paginated for all indexes</b>, because you have to for high-volume transactional systems.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Open Source infrastructure</h2>
				<p>The software powering this system is full open source and unencumbered for worldwide adoption and
					adaptation.
					The products listed within it are a different story, but the system itself is completely free to use
					for
					your own purposes.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Standardized from the ground up.</h2>
				<p>Pretty much everything you see in this system is an implementation of the HL7 Marketplace 2
					specification,
					jointly developed by Logica Health and derivative of prior works by Dr. Preston Lee.</p>

						<p>In a perfect world, endpoint documentation would be perfectly sync'd with the specification,
							available
							as:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://marketplace-documentation.logicahealth.org">Human-readable specification</a>
								and
								other materials as balloted by HL7: the predominant standards developing organization (SDO) in
								healthcare. You'll definitely want to read at least the first few chapters to understand the
								core
								model concepts and semantic relationships.</li>
								<li><a href="https://marketplace-documentation.logicahealth.org">OpenAPI 3 file</a> for whatever editor and/or client generator you prefer. (Swagger is great if you haven't use it.)</li>
						</ul>
